Project Name: 
Pogostink: Save your Senses

Project Description:
In the future, a litter-ridden world is facing destructive environmental crises. 
Garbage has been spewed everywhere and strange monsters have been formed 
through evolution. The platforms are so deprecated that you can even jump
through them (there are small holes!). Though, that also means that dangers from
above can still hurt you when underneath a platform. That said, it all stinks. 
Like really, really stinks. 
	
Your nose's only hope for survival is to travel and escape your current world 
and find a less stinkier place to live. But to do so, you must traverse the 
perilous night with treacherous monsters and survive. To jump over all of the 
trash, your weapon of choice is a pogostick. You evade, rather than attack, 
in hopes of making it through.

Modules used: random, math, PIL, cmu_graphics (https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/desktop)

Shortcut Commands:
- when loaded into a game, press 'r' key to trigger losing the game
- when not loaded into a game, press 'g' key to trigger starting a game
- these two shortcuts allow testers to easily see the random level generation
    aspect of Pogostink and try playing with different monsters/powerups.

PLEASE NOTE using images in generation may cause performane issues. If it is the 
case, please comment out lines 103-108. Then, all the blocks will merely be 
'colors' instead of images.
